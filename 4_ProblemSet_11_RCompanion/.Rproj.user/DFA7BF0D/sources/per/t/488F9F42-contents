## PH250A: PROBLEM SET #10
### Confounding and EMM

Welcome back! This is the last of four **optional** data analysis companions to P250A Problem Sets. Remember that these companions are intended to be a fun introduction to how epidemiologists perform the calculations you are learning in class. Of course, make sure that you understand how to do the problem sets manually (on paper) _first_ since that's what you'll be asked to do on exams.

Before you get started on this companion, you should have already reviewed the "Introduction to Data Analysis Companions" file on bCourses and the "0_Getting Started" project in the PH250A workspace. These files will provide you with a brief orientation to RStudio Cloud as well as instructions about how to submit the assignment for extra credit, if you choose to do so.

Work through this data analysis companion by running each chunk or line of code one by one within this file. You can execute an entire chunk of code by clicking the green arrow located at the top right of the chunk - if you hover your cursor above this arrow, you will see "Run Current Chunk." You can also run individual lines of code by placing your cursor inside a line of code and pressing *Cmd+Enter* for Mac users or *Ctrl+Enter* for Windows users. For the chunks with multiple lines of code, it may be helpful to run each line of code separately to help you understand what every line is doing.

### Overview
This analysis companion will cover Problems #3 and #4 from Problem Set #10. These questions focus on the potential relationship between exposure to lead and high blood pressure using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ([NHANES](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm)). NHANES is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. We will be using data from adults (>=20 years of age) in 2015-2016, which is the most recent survey round available. Note that we'll be using *unweighted* data for this exercise.

### NHANES methodology
As you already know from previous companions, the NHANES survey examines a nationally representative sample of about 5,000 persons each year. These persons are located in counties across the United States, 15 of which are visited each year. The study is unique in that it combines interviews and physical examinations. The NHANES interview includes demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-related questions. The examination component consists of medical, dental, and physiological measurements, as well as laboratory tests administered by highly trained medical personnel. You can read more about the methodology [here](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2015).

### Learning about the dataset

First, let's load the R packages we'll need for this exercise

```{r}

library(EpiStats)
library(dplyr) 
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(ggplot2)

```

Next, let's read in our data:

```{r}

setwd("/cloud/project") # This tells RStudio Cloud where to find the dataset
nhanes_lead <- read.csv("nhanes_lead.csv",header=TRUE) # This tells R to  import the data, which are in "CSV" (comma-separated value) format

```

Let's get oriented to our dataset by using the str() and head() commands:

```{r}

str(nhanes_lead)
head(nhanes_lead)

```

In the first output, you can see we have data on 2,454 adults and the dataset has 11 variables. In the second output (click on the second box, labeled "data.frame 6x11," if you ran both lines of code at the same time), you get a peek at the first 6 records and the values of the 11 variables. For example, the person with the ID (seqn)=83741 is 22 years of age and has a mean systolic blood pressure of 111.33. 

### Primary Outcome: Hypertension

Let's take a look at the primary outcome of hypertension. To classify someone as having high blood pressure, we need both *systolic* and *diastolic* blood pressure. These inputs are then used to categorize individuals according to the following [classification system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9633/table/A32/).

The blood pressure is measured in NHANES as follows: After resting quietly in a seated position for 5 minutes in the mobile examination center, three consecutive blood pressure readings are obtained from the participant. If a BP measurement is interrupted or incomplete, a fourth attempt may be made. 

Let's take a look at the blood pressure related variables in this dataset:

```{r}
# Let's ask R to print out information on blood pressure
# This code will print rows 1 - 5 and columns 6 - 9 of our dataset, which correspond to the blood pressure variables for the first five adults in the dataset 

nhanes_lead[1:5, 6:9]

```
You can see we have mean systolic blood pressure (meansys), the average of the three readings, and likewise mean diastolic blood presure (meandi), which is also the average of the three readings. Together these were used to classify people into whether or not they have hypertension (the variables labeled "bp" and "hbp").

Now, what do you think the 0s, 1s, and 2s mean in the variable "bp"? We need to add a label to these data so we can understand what the values mean. Epidemiologists often code values of their variables as numbers but then add a label to describe what each code means.

```{r}

# Tell R to assign labels to the values (levels) of 0, 1, and 2 for the bp variable

nhanes_lead$bp <- factor(nhanes_lead$bp, levels = c(0,1,2), labels = c("normal", "prehypertension", "hypertension"))  

```

### ACTIVITY 

What do you think R did with the code above? Re-print the data with rows 1-5 and columns 6-9. 

```{r}
# INSERT CODE HERE

# ANSWER
nhanes_lead[1:5, 6:9]

```
Wow! Now the "bp" column is a lot easier to understand. Based on the following [classification system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9633/table/A32/), can you see why the first person, with a mean systolic blood pressure of 122.67 and a mean diastolic blood pressure of 65.33, is classified as being 'prehypertensive'?

So what does the "hbp" variable mean? If you look at the table above, you can see that hbp=1 whenever a person is classified as hypertensive, and hbp=0 if they are prehypertensive or normal. Let's confirm this hunch with a 2x2 table:

```{r}

bptable <- table(nhanes_lead$bp,nhanes_lead$hbp)
bptable

```

On the left hand side of the output above we have the categories of "bp" (normal, prehypertension, and hypertension), and across the top we have the categories of "hbp" (0 and 1). The numbers in the cells are the numbers of people. So, you can see that all 501 people with hypertension are classified as hbp=1. All the people with normal blood pressure (n=978) or prehypertension (n=975) are classified as hbp=0. 

Now that we understand the data, let's visualize mean systolic blood pressure data by age. As a side note, R is well known for its beautiful graphics. You can even download packages to make graphics similar to your favorite publications, like one of Sandi's favorites [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/). 

```{r, message=FALSE}

attach(nhanes_lead)
plot(age, meansys, main="Scatterplot of Mean Systolic Blood Pressure by Age", 
  	xlab="age ", ylab="Mean systolic BP ", pch=20)

```

Do  you see any trends?

## ACTIVITY

Take a look at [this](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/r-plot-pch-symbols-the-different-point-shapes-available-in-r) cool R "codebook" for plotting symbols. Can you change the scatterplot code below to display asterisks(*) instead of black dots?

```{r}
# Modify the code below to display asterisks(*) instead of black dots

plot(age, meansys, main="Scatterplot of Mean Systolic Blood Pressure by Age", 
  	xlab="age ", ylab="Mean systolic BP ", pch=20)

# ANSWER
plot(age, meansys, main="Scatterplot of Mean Systolic Blood Pressure by Age", 
  	xlab="age ", ylab="Mean systolic BP ", pch=8)
```

Now let's take a look at our primary exposure, blood lead level. Here, we've classified "high" blood lead according to 2015 recommendations from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), which designated 5 µg/dL (five micrograms per deciliter) of whole blood, in a venous blood sample, as the reference blood lead level for adults. So, pbhigh=1 for anyone with >=5 µg/dL of lead in their blood sample, and pbhigh=0 otherwise. 

```{r}

#This R code will to make a nice table of lead exposure:

table1 <- xtabs (data=nhanes_lead, ~pbhigh)
table1 %>% kable(col.names=c("Lead Exposure (>=5 µg/dL)", "No.")) %>%
kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = F, position = "left")

```

### Problem 3A

Now let's take a look at the association between blood lead level and hypertension. You probably recognize this code from previous analysis companions. 

```{r}

CC(nhanes_lead, "hbp", "pbhigh", full=FALSE) 

```

Did the most appropriate measure of association in this output match what you got in Problem #3A? Note that in past data analysis companions, we've used the CS() command, which stands for "cohort study" and gives you the RR, for example. Here, we are using the CC() commmand, which is technically for case-control studies, but outputs the odds ratio, which is appropriate here given the cross-sectional nature of the data. 

### Problem 3B and 3C

Now let's take a look at the association between blood lead level and hypertension, stratified by a third factor, household income: 

```{r}
# This code tells R that we want to look for "interactions" by the variable "highincome"

CCInter(nhanes_lead, cases="hbp", exposure = "pbhigh", by = "highincome") 

```
First take a look at second output, data.frame 14x7. Do a quick gut check that the data in the Problem Set matches the 2x2 tables you see above. Scroll to the right using the black arrow if needed to see the ORs for each table. You can check the work that you did by hand and see if you reach the same conclusion as in Problem #3B and 3C.

In the third output, data.frame 4x4, you can see the test for homogeneity (P=0.97, fail to reject the null hypothesis that the measure of association for the strata are similar) and the crude OR (same as in the code chunk above). You can also see the adjusted OR, if we wanted to do that, using the Mantel-Haenzel method (OR=1.70). 

For fun, let's create a boxplot of mean systolic blood pressure by lead exposure:

```{r}
# To create these boxplots by lead exposure, let's try ggplot. This package is more robust than base R for graphics and allows for greater formatting control.

# First, we'll tell R to treat our lead exposure as a factor variable so we can add labels like we did with the bp variable above - this will enable us to show the labels more easily on the graph

nhanes_lead$pbhighcat<-2-pbhigh
nhanes_lead$pbhighcat <-as.factor(nhanes_lead$pbhighcat)
nhanes_lead$pbhighcat <- factor(nhanes_lead$pbhighcat, levels = c(1,2), labels = c("Low", "High"))  

# Next, we'll create the boxplots

plot <- ggplot(nhanes_lead, aes(x = pbhighcat, y = meansys, fill=pbhighcat)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Mean systolic BP (mmHg)", limits=c(0, 200)) +
  scale_x_discrete(name = "Lead Exposure") +
  ggtitle("Boxplot of Systolic Blood Pressure by Lead Exposure")
 
plot

```


### ACTIVITY

Problem 4B: Let's repeat the process above but look at age as the potential confounder or effect measure modifier. In this dataset, age is classified into a binary variable describing whether someone is younger than 65 years of age (age65=0) or at least 65 years of age (age65=1). 

First, look at the association between lead and high blood pressure using the CC command. 

```{r}

# INSERT CODE HERE

# Answer
CC(nhanes_lead, "hbp", "pbhigh", full=FALSE) 
```

Now, examine the relationship between lead and high blood pressure, stratified by age, using the CCInter command. 

```{r}

# INSERT CODE HERE

# Answer
CCInter(nhanes_lead, cases="hbp", exposure = "pbhigh", by = "age65") 

```
Toggle through all of the output from these two lines of code. Did you reach the same conclusion about the role of age as you did in Problem #4B and #4C?
